  before code review:

    Hong:

      high priority:


      low priority:
        limited size of some cols in db?
        figure out some unhandled exceptions
        Time stamp for log bag
        change data type for log bag
        fix logic for merging two precincts




maybe:
Maybe change maps to String format
Change coords to json format
Maybe change maps to json format





for the merge precincts api, you sent a list of two precincts,

first one is the primary p which will be udpated in the database, and second one is the secondary which will be delete from the data

the first precinct should already be merged in the client with all the attr except for adjacentPrecinctIds
for example, if population for first one is 2 , sec is 5
by the time you send the request, the population for first precinct should already be 7, (sec precinct's attr doesn't matter except for its adjacentPrecinctIds) so is other attrs 
The server is mainly dealing with the recursive realtions betwwen two adjacentPrecinctIds which need to be update bidirectionally



good convention /api via post method for addition, via put method for modification
add delete change comment/other datas by sending a put request to savePrecinct api
